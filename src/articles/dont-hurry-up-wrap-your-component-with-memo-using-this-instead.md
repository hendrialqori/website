```jsx:JSX
export const ChildrenComponent = () => {

  console.count('Children component Render!')

  return (
    <section>
      <h1>This is Children Component!</h1>
    </section>
  )
}
```

```jsx:JSX
import { useState } from 'react'
import { ChildrenComponent } from './'

const Parent = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    // Api sending request code this
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor='name'>Your name</label>
        <input
          id='name'
          value={name}
          onChange={(evt) => setName(evt.target.value)}
          type='text'
          />
      </form>
      <ChildrenComponent />
    </main>
  )
}

export default Parent;
```

What do you thing about component code above ?  
There's nothing wrong with it all, but *ChildrenComponent* would be re-render multiple times if name state is change,
It happened bacause has data changes in the parent component.  
<br />
There's actually nothing wrong with the re-renders if no heavy process in *Children Component* it.
Imagine has a heavy process let's say **calling API from server** with many data. Its would be something bad for **optimization** your App. 
<br />
The way to solve it is wrap *ChildrenComponent* with **memo**, example code below!

```jsx:JSX
import { memo } from 'react';

export const ChildrenComponent = memo(function _() => {

  console.count('Children component Render!')

  return (
    <section>
      <h1>This is Children Component!</h1>
    </section>
  )
})
```

<br />
This way has enough for prevent re-renders problems,  
But i have own way to resolve this problem with make **separated component**

```jsx:JSX
import { useState } from 'react'
import { ChildrenComponent } from './'


const ChildrenComponentTwo = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    // Api sending request code this
  }
  return (
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor='name'>Your name</label>
        <input
          id='name'
          value={name}
          onChange={(evt) => setName(evt.target.value)}
          type='text'
          />
      </form>
  )
}

const Parent = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <ChildrenComponent />
      <ChildrenComponentTwo />
    </main>
  )
}

export default Parent;
```

<br />
The above way make **ChildrenComponent** not re-renders again because there's nothing data changed in Parent component.
This is one way of dealing with these re-renders problem with React component.  
<br />
**Thank you for reading!**
